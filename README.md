# DATA 3550_Fall2023-Midterm Project   Submission Guidelines

## Scenario

Imagine that you are part of a data science team hired by ABC Housing LLC in Murfreesboro, specializing in buying and selling houses. Your role is to develop an accurate prediction model for the "Saleprice" of houses. Collaborating with your team, you'll need to convey your findings to a manager who lacks familiarity with statistics and data science. The ultimate aim of your project report is to provide insights that will guide the company's real estate decisions. Additionally, the company is interested in identifying the top five crucial factors influencing house prices. Concluding the project, your team will deliver a concise presentation highlighting your discoveries.

## Jupyter Notebook Formatting Guidelines

It is very important that your Jupyter Notebook is formatted correctly with markdown, comments, and code that works. You may lose lot of points if the formatting guidelines is not followed and the results are not adequately explained.
Please do the following for each section

* Include a title as a Heading 2
* Include a brief summary of the section
* Include your code and make sure it is executable and correct, include comments with the code.
* At the end of the section, include a brief summary of the results.

## Power Point Presentation Formatting Guidelines

Your PowerPoint presentation should encompass the outlined sections, each corresponding to the respective guideline sections. The presentation structure should follow:

1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (Section 2)**
2. **Feature Engineering (Section 3)**
3. **Data Imputation (Section 4)**
4. **Train/Test Split and Scaling (Section 5)**
5. **Multiple Regression (Section 6)**
6. **LASSO Regression (Section 7)**
7. **Ridge Regression (Section 8)**
8. **Kernel Ridge Regression (Section 9)**
9. **Model Comparison (Section 10)**
10. **Conclusion (Section 10)**

Each section should be clear, concise, and visually engaging. Ensure that your presentation effectively communicates the key points, methods used, results obtained, and any insights or conclusions drawn. Feel free to incorporate relevant graphs, charts, and examples to enhance the clarity of your content.

**Note: The total number of slides should be between 13 - 15 including the title slide**


## How to turn it in:

** You will turn in the notebook file and also upload a presentation slides**

*  Your Jupyter notebook file must be named Data3550MidPro_LastnameFirstInitial.ipynb. For example: the file name will be Data3550MidPro_RimalR.ipynb if I submit the Midterm Project.
* You are to turn in your Jupyter notebook file only. No data files and no folders.
* It is assumed that you created your Jupyter notebook in a folder named Data3550MidPro_student and in that folder is a Dataset folder. It is expected the path for importing a file is looking for a data folder, for example ‘Dataset/DF_AH.csv’.
* Additionally, for the presentation, save it as a PowerPoint file with the name: Data3550MidPro_GroupName.ppt. For instance, if your group name is LASSO, the file should be named Data3550MidPro_LASSO.ppt.

** Please make sure to adhere to these guidelines when submitting your materials for the Midterm Project**
